## Problem Statement
You are in a village. An NGO works over there. The NGO collects data from villagers about
their health status quarterly through paper forms. Later these reams of paper are given to
statistical department wherein the data are entered manually by data entry operators. Then,
these are analyzed for insights about particular village so that further interventions for health
could be made and decisions taken. As a CS student, you are intrigued at this old practice and
want to change this using your technical expertise. So, you think of creating a Tablet-based
app to directly take the information from the villagers, in the language of their choice. Usually
people collecting these data cannot read English, so you have to create an app which has local
language (Marathi, Bengali, Hindi etc.). The catch is that these areas do not have mobile
networks and you want to sync the records you collect in these areas on a cloud based server.
So, you collect data and develop a machinery which syncs this data to cloud when network is
available. With these given constraints design a solution that should be able to do the
following:
1. Collect data of villagers on several parameters (demography, health status, education
level, socio-economic position).
2. Develop a functionality to analyse this data and gather insights (both in numerical
summary and graphical visualization)
a. Distribution of age in the population.
b. Proportion of different diseases the villagers are suffering from.
c. The distribution of socio-economic status, education level in the village.
3. Automatically update the database/excel of records everything a new record is added.
4. Maintain a different database for a different village.
